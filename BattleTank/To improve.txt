- Projectile_BP -> ExplosionForce -> Radial Force Component -> Radius - 
works only if radius is >440. Magnitude below ends with no movement at all regardless
the magnitudes of the rest of quantities (force, impulse..)

- Menu collision - when opens by menu-level tanks have only one main collision on the body - 
the collision on tracks doesn't work, so they cannot move and are 40% in the ground.

- add powerups, or trigger volumes with extra health/ammo/shield
